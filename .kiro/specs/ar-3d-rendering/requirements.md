# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AR 3D Rendering feature will enhance the Kids Tutor app by adding augmented reality capabilities that display 3D models of detected objects in real-time. When the app detects a letter or object through the camera, it will render a corresponding 3D model in augmented reality, allowing children to interact with and learn about objects in a more immersive way. This feature will make learning more engaging and help children better understand the connection between letters, words, and real-world objects.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a child user, I want to see 3D models of objects when the app recognizes them through the camera, so that I can learn about objects in a more interactive and engaging way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app detects a letter or object through the camera THEN the system SHALL display a corresponding 3D model in augmented reality.
2. WHEN a 3D model is displayed THEN the system SHALL position it relative to the detected object in the camera view.
3. WHEN multiple objects are detected THEN the system SHALL prioritize displaying the model with the highest confidence score.
4. WHEN a 3D model is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating the connection between the detected object and the 3D model.
5. WHEN the detected object moves in the camera view THEN the system SHALL update the position of the 3D model accordingly.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a parent or educator, I want to be able to toggle AR features on/off, so that I can control the learning experience based on the child's needs and device capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the settings page THEN the system SHALL provide an option to enable/disable AR features.
2. WHEN AR features are disabled THEN the system SHALL fall back to the current 2D display of detected objects.
3. WHEN AR features are enabled on a device that doesn't support AR THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and show an appropriate message.
4. WHEN the user changes the AR setting THEN the system SHALL persist this preference for future app sessions.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a child user, I want the 3D models to be visually appealing and accurately represent the objects they depict, so that I can easily recognize and learn about them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a 3D model is displayed THEN the system SHALL render it with appropriate textures, colors, and details.
2. WHEN a 3D model is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure it is properly scaled relative to the camera view.
3. WHEN a 3D model is displayed THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate lighting to make it look realistic.
4. WHEN a 3D model is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure it is rendered at a minimum of 30 frames per second for smooth visualization.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a child user, I want to be able to interact with the 3D models, so that I can explore them from different angles and learn more about them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a 3D model is displayed THEN the system SHALL allow the user to tap on it to trigger additional information or animations.
2. WHEN the user taps on a 3D model THEN the system SHALL display the name and pronunciation of the object.
3. WHEN the user performs a pinch gesture on a 3D model THEN the system SHALL allow scaling the model up or down.
4. WHEN the user performs a rotation gesture on a 3D model THEN the system SHALL rotate the model accordingly.
5. WHEN a 3D model is interacted with THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate visual and/or audio feedback.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AR implementation to be efficient and performant, so that it works well on a wide range of devices without draining battery or causing lag.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AR feature is active THEN the system SHALL maintain a frame rate of at least 24 FPS on supported devices.
2. WHEN the AR feature is active THEN the system SHALL optimize memory usage to prevent crashes on lower-end devices.
3. WHEN the AR feature is active THEN the system SHALL efficiently load and unload 3D models to minimize memory usage.
4. WHEN the app is running in the background THEN the system SHALL pause AR processing to conserve battery.
5. WHEN the device temperature becomes too high THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade AR features to prevent overheating.
